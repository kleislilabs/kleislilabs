# Kleisli Labs Website Blueprint

## Layout Structure

- **Header (Navbar):** A fixed, top **StickyHeader** with the Kleisli Labs logo and anchor links to each section (e.g. *Home*, *Services*, *About*, *Blog*, *Contact*). Use a full-width container. As users scroll, the nav stays visible to speed navigation[smashingmagazine.com](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/05/sticky-menus-ux-guidelines/#:~:text=As%20users%20scroll%2C%20a%20sticky,want%20to%20speed%20up%20navigation). Links smoothly scroll to sections (e.g. `#services`, `#contact`).
- **Hero Section (`HeroBanner`):** Full-bleed 12-column container. Two-column grid: left column (~6 of 12) with a **H1** (“Igniting Early-Stage AI Ventures”) and subtitle paragraph (USP), plus primary CTA buttons (“Get Audit”, “See Our Work”); right column (~6 of 12) with a large illustrative/abstract hero image. The H1 and subheading establish the value prop immediately, and CTAs above the fold encourage action. Background may use a subtle tech-themed illustration or gradient.
- **Clients/Trust Logos (`LogoGrid`):** A section titled **“Trusted by Early-Stage Innovators”** (H2). Use a multi-column grid (e.g. 4–6 logos per row on desktop) to display partner or client logos. Each logo is a uniformly sized image/icon. This builds credibility. Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to make the logo rows responsive (e.g. 12-col with each logo spanning 3–4 cols)[developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Realizing_common_layouts_using_grids#:~:text=A%20flexible%2012). Include a short caption or “*Over 20 startups trust Kleisli Labs*” above.
- **Our Services (`ServicesGrid`):** Title the section **“Our Services”** (H2). List the five core offerings (AI QuickStart, Prompt Foundry, Data Engine, Model Clinic, Investor Pack) as **cards** in a responsive grid. Each card (component: `ServiceCard`) contains an icon or image at top, an H3 service title, a brief paragraph, and a small link or arrow. Use a 3- or 4-column layout on desktop (e.g. first row 3 cards, second row 2 cards, or all 5 in one wrap). Cards should have equal height rows, padding, and subtle hover effect (see Interactive). The card layout leverages the fact that *“UI cards are versatile, responsive, and scannable”*[uxdesigninstitute.comuxdesigninstitute.com](https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/card-design-for-ui/#:~:text=,to%20be%20overwhelmed%20with%20dense). On mobile, stack cards one per row.
- **Our Approach (`ProcessSection`):** Introduce a section **“How Kleisli Works”** (H2) or similar. Use a step-by-step layout (e.g. horizontal timeline or vertical list) describing the co-founder process (Concept ▶ Prototype ▶ Build ▶ Scale). Each step is a mini-card with an icon, step title, and short text. This can be a 4-column grid (one step per col) that collapses to a stacked layout on mobile. Alternatively, use a two-column layout with an illustrative image on one side and the steps list on the other. This shows the methodology of “from idea to Series A”.
- **Portfolio / Open-Source Projects (`PortfolioGrid`):** Section **“Our Work”** (H2). Display a gallery or card grid (3 columns) of past projects or open-source repos. Each item is an image or screenshot thumbnail with a title overlay and link to case study or GitHub. On hover, cards can zoom slightly or reveal a brief description (hover animation). Use 3 cards per row on desktop, 1–2 on tablet. This section can also link to the full portfolio or blog if desired.
- **Testimonials (`TestimonialCarousel`):** Title **“What Founders Say”** (H2). Show 2–3 client quotes at once (if many testimonials, use a carousel/slider). Each testimonial card has the quote text, person’s name/title, and company logo or headshot. Arrange in a 2-column grid on large screens (one row of 2) or stacked. Ensure quotes and names use a readable hierarchy (H3 for name, italics/blockquote style for text). This section provides social proof.
- **Blog / Resources Preview (`BlogTeasers`):** Section **“Insights”** or **“From the Lab”** (H2). Feature 3 recent blog posts or articles as cards (image, title H3, excerpt, “Read More” link). 3 columns on desktop, single column on mobile. Encourage visitors to engage with content.
- **AI Readiness Audit / Contact (`ContactSection`):** Title **“Get Your AI Readiness Audit”** (H2). This combines lead gen and contact. Present a short pitch (1–2 sentences) next to or above a simple form (fields: Name, Email, Company, Message). Use 2-column grid: form on left, a supporting image or list of benefits on right (on mobile, form full-width). Validation should check for required fields and email format. Place a bold primary **Submit** button. Below or alongside, include additional CTAs or a brief contact info. This is the main conversion form.
- **Footer:** Full-width footer with multiple columns of nav links (e.g. Services, Resources, Company, Legal). Also include social icons. Optionally, a final CTA (e.g. “Let’s Talk” with contact link). Copyright and privacy links at bottom.

For each section, use a responsive 12-column grid pattern[developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Realizing_common_layouts_using_grids#:~:text=A%20flexible%2012). Common patterns: hero 2-column, services 3–4 columns, logos 4+ columns, text sections full-width or 2-col, footers 3–4 columns. Parent-child hierarchies: each section has a container component (e.g. `SectionWrapper`) with children like headings, text blocks, image, and grid rows as needed.

## Visual Elements

*Figure: Abstract network illustration (AI/data theme) setting a high-tech tone for Kleisli Labs.* The color palette should reinforce Kleisli’s “ignite” theme with tech trust. For example: a **deep navy blue** (e.g. #102A43) as primary (reliable, tech-savvy tone), a **bright flame orange** (e.g. #FF6F61) as accent (energy, urgency), and a **teal or cyan** highlight (e.g. #0EDDAA) for freshness. Use white or very light gray (e.g. #F7FAFC) for backgrounds. Blue is widely used in tech to inspire trust[piktochart.com](https://piktochart.com/blog/website-color-schemes/#:~:text=The%20emotional%20aspect%20is%20one,use%20of%20blue%20to%20inspire). All colors should meet contrast guidelines.

- **Typography:** A clean, modern sans-serif (e.g. *Inter*, *Roboto* or *Poppins*) for all text. Font weights: bold for headings, normal for body. Scale headings progressively: for example, H1 ~48px, H2 ~36px, H3 ~28px, H4 ~22px, H5 ~18px, H6 ~16px (with corresponding line-heights). This follows a modular scale (~1.25–1.5× increase per level)[hanjing.medium.com](https://hanjing.medium.com/font-sizing-4259801c04c1#:~:text=Headings%20should%20have%20a%20progressive,5x%20increase%20between%20each%20level). Body text ~16px (1rem) for readability on desktop (ensuring no smaller than 16px for mobile per best practice)[learnui.design](https://www.learnui.design/blog/mobile-desktop-website-font-size-guidelines.html#:~:text=2,be%20at%20least%2016px). Keep only 3–4 heading levels in use to maintain clarity[hanjing.medium.com](https://hanjing.medium.com/font-sizing-4259801c04c1#:~:text=Generally%20best%20to%20limit%20the,font%20size%20and%20line%20height). Captions or disclaimers can be a lighter gray.
- **Buttons:** Prominent primary buttons should have **rounded corners** (e.g. 6–8px radius) to appear friendly and touchable – studies show rounded CTAs boost click rates[cieden.com](https://cieden.com/book/sub-atomic/shapes/rounded-buttons-and-usability#:~:text=,higher). Use the orange accent for primary buttons (white text), and secondary buttons in a neutral (e.g. dark text on white with border). On hover, buttons may slightly darken or increase drop-shadow. Transitions on hover/active (150–200ms ease) signal interactivity.
- **Imagery & Icons:** Use a **consistent illustrative style**. Custom flat or semi-flat vector illustrations of AI concepts (networks, data flow, robots, founders collaborating) can make abstract tech ideas tangible[smartbugmedia.com](https://www.smartbugmedia.com/blog/website-design-photos-illustrations#:~:text=,If%20your%20website%20focuses%20on). These should use the brand palette. For icons (e.g. in services cards), use flat line/icons (SVG) in the accent color. Avoid overly photo-realistic stock imagery except selectively (e.g. a photo of the founding team in “About”). Illustrations give a modern, cohesive look and can stand out as custom artwork[smartbugmedia.com](https://www.smartbugmedia.com/blog/website-design-photos-illustrations#:~:text=,If%20your%20website%20focuses%20on). Ensure images have uniform treatment (e.g. all line-art or all 3D style) for consistency.

## Interactive Elements

- **Sticky Navigation:** The header stays fixed during scroll[smashingmagazine.com](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/05/sticky-menus-ux-guidelines/#:~:text=As%20users%20scroll%2C%20a%20sticky,want%20to%20speed%20up%20navigation). Nav links use smooth-scroll anchor behavior. On scroll, the current section link can highlight. The header background can switch from transparent (on top) to solid color after scrolling for readability.
- **Forms & Validation:** The AI Audit form should validate inputs on blur (inline validation) so users fix errors immediately[nngroup.com](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/errors-forms-design-guidelines/#:~:text=1,Whenever%20Possible). For example, if email is malformed or name blank, show a red error message next to the field. Successful inputs can show a green check. Keep error messages concise and next to fields[nngroup.com](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/errors-forms-design-guidelines/#:~:text=1,Whenever%20Possible). Use HTML5 required attributes and accessible labels. On submit, if errors remain, scroll to the first error.
- **Modal (Lead Magnet):** Clicking “Get Audit” or “Download Deck” can open a modal dialog with a quick signup (email capture) or a PDF download prompt. Use sparingly – only for the highest-value content – and ensure it’s easy to close[nngroup.com](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/errors-forms-design-guidelines/#:~:text=,Use%20Tooltips%20to%20Report%20Errors). Animate the modal fade-in (fade+scale over ~200ms) and darken background.
- **Hover Animations:** To indicate interactivity, use subtle animations: e.g. service cards or “See More” links slightly lift (scale 1.03) on hover, with a smooth transition (150ms). Client logos can fade to color or enlarge on hover (keeping brand logos grayscale by default). Do not overdo motion – keep all hover effects short and meaningful[nngroup.com](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/animation-duration/#:~:text=Animations%20in%20user%20experience%20can,their%20purpose%20and%20their%20execution).
- **Scroll-triggered Effects:** As the user scrolls, sections can fade or slide into view (trigger on entry using CSS or IntersectionObserver). For example, the Services cards can fade in and move up slightly when that section enters the viewport. Ensure animations respect “prefers-reduced-motion” for accessibility[nngroup.com](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/animation-duration/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20important%20to%20note%20that,%E2%80%9Creduce%20motion%E2%80%9D%20by%20removing%20animations). Use eased transitions (e.g. 0.3s ease-out) so animations feel natural.
- **Interactive Logo/Client Sections:** In the logo grid, on hover a logo could highlight or pop out slightly. Or clicking a logo could open a quick modal of that client’s brief testimonial or case snippet. But ensure primary logos remain clickable if they link externally.

## Content Structure

- **Headings:** Use one H1 (“Igniting Early-Stage AI Ventures”) for the hero. Each major section title is an H2. Subsections (e.g. individual service names) use H3. Avoid over-nesting beyond H4. Follow the rule that headings should be concise and informative[hanjing.medium.com](https://hanjing.medium.com/font-sizing-4259801c04c1#:~:text=Headings%20should%20have%20a%20progressive,5x%20increase%20between%20each%20level). For example, use “Our Services” (H2) instead of a long sentence.
- **Text:** Keep paragraphs short (2–4 sentences each) for scannability. Each section can have a brief intro sentence or two followed by bullet lists or CTAs. For instance, in Services, the service cards carry most text. In approach/process steps, use short blurbs under each step. All body text should stay under ~100 words per section before breaking.
- **CTA Placement:** Place primary call-to-action buttons prominently at the end of major sections (e.g. after Services list: “View Full Portfolio” or after Testimonials: “Partner with Us”). The main form’s submit is a CTA. Also include a final footer CTA (e.g. “Schedule a Call”). CTAs should stand out in color and often repeated for conversion.
- **Card Layouts:** Use card components for Services, Blog teasers, and Testimonials. As noted, cards should have consistent padding and aspect ratio. For Services and Blog, use a grid: each card with an image/icon on top, title (H3), short text, and link. Cards help chunk content – they are *“scannable”* containers[uxdesigninstitute.comuxdesigninstitute.com](https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/card-design-for-ui/#:~:text=,to%20be%20overwhelmed%20with%20dense).
- **Media and Figures:** Where images or illustrations appear, include a short caption (small italic) if needed to explain context. For example, a diagram of the AI process can have a caption. Captions (if used) can be styled smaller and lighter.
- **Link Structure:** Ensure all CTAs and internal links follow a logical flow: e.g. “Get Audit” leads to the form; “Learn More” on services leads to detail sections; company logo links to home.
- **Footer Content:** Use H6 or paragraph style for footer titles (“Company”, “Services”, etc.) with lists of links. Keep footer text minimal and legible.
