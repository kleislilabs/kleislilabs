# Welcome to Our Next.js Blog

This is our first blog post written in Markdown! This blog demonstrates how to build a static blog using Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Markdown files.

## Features

- **Static Generation**: Fast loading times with pre-rendered pages
- **Markdown Support**: Write posts in Markdown for easy content management
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Modern and responsive styling
- **SEO Optimized**: Built-in metadata support

## Getting Started

To create a new blog post, simply:

1. Create a new `.md` file in the `posts/` directory
2. Add frontmatter with title, date, excerpt, and tags
3. Write your content in Markdown
4. The blog will automatically generate the page!

## Code Example

Here's a simple TypeScript function:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## Conclusion

This blog setup provides a solid foundation for content creators who want to focus on writing while maintaining a professional, fast-loading website.

Happy blogging! ðŸŽ‰
