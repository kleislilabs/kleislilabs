## Environment

Create `.env.local` (not committed):

```
# Only needed if you switch back to the Firecrawl SaaS SDK (currently not used)
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

No secrets are required for the default HTTP metadata fetcher.

## Development

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000.

## Blogging workflow

1. Add a Markdown file to `posts/your-post.md`.
2. Include frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2025-01-13"
excerpt: "Brief description"
tags: ["nextjs", "blog"]
---
```

3. Use citations as lines anywhere in the file (often in a Sources comment):

```
[^1]: https://example.com/page
[^2]: https://another.com/article
```

4. In text, reference citations with `[^1]`, `[^2]`. The renderer will convert consecutive `[^n]` into compact domain pills like `example.com +1`.

## Build and previews

Citation hovercards use build-time previews with title/description/siteLogoUrl, generated once and embedded.

- Previews are built before Next’s SSG by `scripts/build-citation-previews.mjs`.
- Output is written to `public/previews/[slug].json`.
- The page reads and inlines this JSON; no runtime network calls on hover.

Commands:

```bash
# Build previews for all posts, then Next build
npm run build

# Force refresh previews for a post, then rebuild
rm -f public/previews/ai-outsourcing-guide-2025.json
npm run build
```

### How previews are generated

- Extract: `src/lib/citations/extract.ts` scans markdown for `[^n]: URL` lines.
- Fetch: `src/lib/citations/fetch-firecrawl.ts` uses direct HTTP GETs to fetch HTML and parse:
  - title: og:title → twitter:title → <title>
  - description: og:description → description → twitter:description
  - siteLogoUrl: link[rel=icon] → twitter:image → og:image (absolute URL)
  - image: og:image → twitter:image (for future use)
- Throttling & logging:
  - 1 request at a time, ~1.5s delay in prebuild (adjust in script) with detailed logs (status, size, truncated notes).

### Styling & behavior

- Citation pills are compact rounded rectangles with domain label and optional `+N` when several consecutive citations share the same domain.
- Hovercard is a small popover with title, description (if any), and uses `siteLogoUrl` when available; click opens the source in a new tab.

## Common issues

- Build takes too long and fails:
  - Ensure previews are generated in prebuild (they are). Do not delete `public/previews/*.json` before build unless you intend to re-crawl.

- No hovercard on some pills:
  - Some sources don’t expose title/description meta; the pill still opens the source.

- Brand image missing:
  - `siteLogoUrl` falls back to `link[rel=icon]`. Not all sites provide icons; the card renders without an image.

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start Next dev (Turbopack)
- `npm run build` — run prebuild previews then SSG
- `npm start` — serve production build

## Contributing

- Keep code DRY and typed. Shared logic under `src/lib/citations/*` and `src/lib/rehype-citations.ts`.
- For UI, keep styles in `src/app/globals.css` under the citation section (`.citation-link`, `.citation-pill`, `.citation-count`).
- Prefer small, focused PRs with a brief summary of:
  - What changed
  - Why
  - Any user-facing impact
